## Data Structure

Organizations are stored with the following fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Organization name
- `category`: Type of organization
- `address`: Street address
- `city`, `state`, `zipcode`: Location details
- `lat`, `lon`: Coordinates (if available)
- `description`: Detailed description
- `status`: Verification status (pending, in-progress, done)
- `notes`: Verification notes

## Customization

### Adding New Organizations
Edit the `organizations` list in `app.py` to add new organizations.

### Modifying Categories
Categories are automatically detected from the organizations data. To add a new category, simply add organizations with that category.

### Adjusting Map Center
The map automatically centers based on organization locations. To change the default, modify the center coordinates in the `/api/map` route.
