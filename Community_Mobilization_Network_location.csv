For us, mission doesn’t just mean a far-off place. It’s an everyday endeavor, across the street and across Northern Virginia. Here are the services we currently provide in the community.

FOOD PANTRY
Many families have to choose between rent and food. Hope for NOVA helps alleviate one choice through our emergency food assistance.

CLOTHING CLOSET
Properly fitting and warm clothes aren’t luxuries every family is able to provide. Hope for NOVA offers a clothing closet filled with new or gently used donations of clothing and accessories for men, women and children. Beyond the everyday, we aim to help our shoppers during events in life: the birth of a new baby, the first day of school, a wedding or an interview for a new job.

KIDS OUTREACH
Hope for NOVA seeks to create a second home-like atmosphere for nearby children to grow and develop healthy relationships with volunteers and one another while receiving character-building Bible lessons, recreation and nutritious meals. Hope for NOVA teams with local public schools to host professional tutoring for students who are below their grade level in reading. This program’s focus is on building the foundation for children to trust, hope and begin to dream.

DISCIPLESHIP
At the root of many issues in our modern world is the lack of a relationship with Christ. So, we work to teach people how to have their spiritual needs fulfilled by relating to God personally through prayer, Bible study and community.

IMMIGRATION SERVICES
Hope For NOVA assists people who face immigration and language challenges through the sponsorship of legal screenings and citizenship classes; hosting immigration briefings; and hosting ESL classes.  We also provide a summertime “Mommy and Me” preschool to help ensure children are well prepared for Kindergarten.

HOLIDAY HELP AND CELEBRATIONS

In January 2022, the Human Services Alliance of Greater Prince William, a nonprofit association of human services providers that aid residents, partnered with the county to administer $10 million in ARPA funds by 2024. This past year, funding was provided for COVID-19 recovery efforts, including navigation for rent, mortgage, and public benefits assistance; utility assistance; childcare costs; and administration for hunger relief programs, among others.

The county and community partners have identified a need to shift the focus of the remaining ARPA funds to support those individuals who need housing rental assistance. Of the original amount, $2.7 million will be allocated through the Alliance to area nonprofits to provide rental assistance to those in need in Prince William County.

“More than $7 million in ARPA funds were previously allocated in 2022 to give county residents greater access to mental and behavioral health assistance, employment support and emergency shelter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” remarks Chair At-Large Ann Wheeler. “Based on current community need, it has been determined that providing rental assistance in the county remains a priority, and these funds of $2.7 million will help fill the gap and best support those in need.”

This funding will be distributed through previously qualified ARPA partners, EduFuturo, New Creatures in Christ and St. Thomas United Methodist Church.

“Our first round of ARPA funds focused on a broad range of COVID-19 relief efforts. Based on the need that has been identified for rent assistance, round two, as originally intended, has been canceled,” explains Peggy Kimmey, Interim Executive Director of The Alliance.  

Applications must be submitted by individuals seeking housing rental assistance. Applications submitted by businesses will not be considered. To learn more about the rental assistance program and for contact information to reach the ARPA partners, go to www.alliancegpw.org/rentassistance.",,,38.7929135,-77.5175528

NVFS Healthy Families provides the tools, guidance, and support that families need to build a healthy, successful life. The program provides free services in Arlington County, Fairfax County, Loudoun County, the Greater Prince William Area, and the City of Alexandria to promote healthy child development and to prevent child abuse and neglect for families with children pre-birth to age 3 or 4 (depending on the jurisdiction.)

Healthy Families’ four goals are to promote positive, nurturing, responsive parenting; improve child health and development; promote school readiness; and prevent child abuse and neglect.

What to Expect: A staff member conducts an initial parent interview to determine eligibility as well as any need for other community resources. Once a family is enrolled, a family support specialist provides regular home visits from pregnancy until the child reaches the age of 3 or 4.",,,40.7035916,-104.7808024

The Combating Hunger on Wheels (C.H.O.W.) Wagon initiative offers multi-layered support to County residents most in need of resources to combat food insecurity and hunger. A child’s ability to realize their future potential is often dependent on the resources they have today. Children exposed to food insecurity are of particular concern to PWCCF and our C.H.O.W. Initiative given the implications scarce food resources pose to a child’s health and development. Children who are food insecure are more likely to be hospitalized and may be at higher risk for developing chronic diseases such as obesity as a result in lower quality diet, anemia and asthma. In addition, food-insecure children may also be at higher risk for behavioral and social issues including fighting, hyperactivity, and anxiety and bullying.

Thanks to a generous benefactor in Prince William County, Virginia, a fund has been set aside to specifically assist military veterans and their families to meet their needs. The program helps both homeless and financially struggling veterans combat hardship where they live. The fund covers financial assistance for rent and mortgage payments, utility bills, food supplies, and—most critical—medical costs. A similar fund provides similar assistance to veterans living in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

In addition to meeting the social service needs of the community, the Prince William Service Center also offers youth programs and opportunities for spiritual nourishment. Families find fellowship in the worship services every Sunday, while kids build friendships and life skills through youth programs and after-school clubs. And when school is out during the summer, the service center opens the doors of its gym, providing a healthy alternative to everyone in the neighborhood.

When a student fails a screening or has academic, social/emotional, or behavioral concerns and a disability is not suspected, the parent is informed, and the student may be referred to the Student Support Team (SST)/Intervention Team (IT).

If a parent is concerned about their child's progress in school, he or she should contact the administrator of their child's school to request a meeting with the SST/IT.

At each school, a group of qualified professionals will problem-solve and develop a Student Support Plan when academic, social/emotional, or behavioral concerns have been identified and a disability is not suspected. The Student Support Team/Intervention Team discusses and ensures the following:

Thanks to a generous benefactor in Prince William County, Virginia, a fund has been set aside to specifically assist military veterans and their families to meet their needs. The program helps both homeless and financially struggling veterans combat hardship where they live. The fund covers financial assistance for rent and mortgage payments, utility bills, food supplies, and—most critical—medical costs. A similar fund provides similar assistance to veterans living in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

In addition to meeting the social service needs of the community, the Prince William Service Center also offers youth programs and opportunities for spiritual nourishment. Families find fellowship in the worship services every Sunday, while kids build friendships and life skills through youth programs and after-school clubs. And when school is out during the summer, the service center opens the doors of its gym, providing a healthy alternative to everyone in the neighborhood.
